-------------How To Install and Configure Elasticsearch on Ubuntu 14.04------------------------

=====Introduction=====

Elasticsearch is a platform for distributed search and analysis of data in real time. Its popularity is due to its ease of use, powerful features, and scalability.
Elasticsearch supports RESTful operations. This means that you can use HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, etc.) in combination with an HTTP URI (/collection/entry) to manipulate your data. The intuitive RESTful approach is both developer and user friendly, which is one of the reasons for Elasticsearch's popularity.
Elasticsearch is a free and open source software with a solid company behind it — Elastic. This combination makes it suitable for use in anywhere from personal testing to corporate integration.


----Prerequisites----

Before following this tutorial, please make sure you complete the following prerequisites:

    A:- Ubuntu 14.04 Droplet
    A:- non-root sudo user. Check out Initial Server Setup with Ubuntu 14.04 for details.

Except otherwise noted, all of the commands that require root privileges in this tutorial should be run as a non-root user with sudo privileges.

Step 1 — Installing Java

First, you will need a Java Runtime Environment (JRE) on your Droplet because Elasticsearch is written in the Java programming language. Elasticsearch requires Java 7 or higher. Elasticsearch recommends Oracle JDK version 1.8.0_73, but the native Ubuntu OpenJDK native package for the JRE works as well.

This step shows you how to install both versions so you can decide which is best for you.
Installing OpenJDK

The native Ubuntu OpenJDK native package for the JRE is free, well-supported, and automatically managed through the Ubuntu APT installation manager.

Before installing OpenJDK with APT, update the list of available packages for installation on your Ubuntu Droplet by running the command:

$ sudo apt-get update

After that, you can install OpenJDK with the command:

$ sudo apt-get install openjdk-7-jre

To verify your JRE is installed and can be used, run the command:

$ java -version

The result should look like this:

java version "1.8.0_121"
Java(TM) SE Runtime Environment (build 1.8.0_121-b13)
Java HotSpot(TM) 64-Bit Server VM (build 25.121-b13, mixed mode)


====Installing Java 8====

When you advance in using Elasticsearch and you start looking for better Java performance and compatibility, you may opt to install Oracle's proprietary Java (Oracle JDK 8).

Add the Oracle Java PPA to apt:

    $ sudo add-apt-repository -y ppa:webupd8team/java

Update your apt package database:

    $ sudo apt-get update

Install the latest stable version of Oracle Java 8 with this command (and accept the license agreement that pops up):

    $ sudo apt-get -y install oracle-java8-installer

Lastly, verify it is installed:

    java -version
    
    
    
    ---Step 2 — Downloading and Installing Elasticsearch---
    
    
    Elasticsearch can be downloaded directly from elastic.co in zip, tar.gz, deb, or rpm packages. For Ubuntu, it's best to use the deb (Debian) package which will install everything you need to run Elasticsearch.

At the time of this writing, the latest Elasticsearch version is 2.4.1 Download it in a directory of your choosing with the command:

$ wget https://download.elastic.co/elasticsearch/release/org/elasticsearch/distribution/deb/elasticsearch/2.4.1/elasticsearch-2.4.1.deb

Then install it in the usual Ubuntu way with the dpkg command like this:

$ dpkg -i elasticsearch-2.4.1.deb

This results in Elasticsearch being installed in /usr/share/elasticsearch/ with its configuration files placed in /etc/elasticsearch and its init script added in /etc/init.d/elasticsearch.
 
--- Please keep in mind these below config is basic recommandation for first step ---

Please create directory  for ES data and ES log files stores.

Like:-

$ mkdir -p elasticsearch/data
$ mkdir -p var/log/elasticsearch/es-1

Please give the permission for these dir.
like:-

$ chmod 755 elasticsearch/data/
$ chmod 755 es-1


Step 3 — Configuring Elastic

Now that Elasticsearch and its Java dependencies have been installed, it is time to configure Elasticsearch.

The Elasticsearch configuration files are in the /etc/elasticsearch directory. There are two files:

    A:- elasticsearch.yml — Configures the Elasticsearch server settings. This is where all options, except those for logging, are stored, which is why we are mostly interested in this file.

    B:- logging.yml — Provides configuration for logging. In the beginning, you don't have to edit this file. You can leave all default logging options. You can find the resulting logs in /var/log/elasticsearch by default.


The first variables to customize on any Elasticsearch server are node.name and cluster.name in elasticsearch.yml. As their names suggest, node.name specifies the name of the server (node) and the cluster to which the latter is associated.

If you don't customize these variable, a node.name will be assigned automatically in respect to the Droplet hostname. The cluster.name will be automatically set to the name of the default cluster.

The cluster.name value is used by the auto-discovery feature of Elasticsearch to automatically discover and associate Elasticsearch nodes to a cluster. Thus, if you don't change the default value, you might have unwanted nodes, found on the same network, in your cluster.

To start editing the main elasticsearch.yml configuration file:

$ sudo nano /etc/elasticsearch/elasticsearch.yml

Remove the # character at the beginning of the lines for node.name and cluster.name to uncomment them, and then change their values. Your first configuration changes in the /etc/elasticsearch/elasticsearch.yml file should look like this

...
node.name: "es-1"
cluster.name: test
...

All ES config is in others file.

Thanks
