Introduction:-

Apache Kafka is an open-source stream processing platform developed by the Apache Software Foundation written in Scala and Java. The project aims to provide a unified, high-throughput,
low-latency platform for handling real-time data feeds.

Befor kafka installation we need to install java lastest version jdk.

Step:-1
Download JDK

If Java is not downloaded, please download the latest version of JDK by visiting the following link and download latest version.
http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index.html

Now the latest version is JDK 8u 60 and the file is “jdk-8u60-linux-x64.tar.gz”. Please download the file on your machine.

Step:-2
Extract Files
Generally, files being downloaded are stored in the downloads folder, verify it and extract the tar setup using the following commands.

$ cd /go/to/download/path
$ tar -zxf jdk-8u60-linux-x64.gz

Step:-3

Move to Opt Directory

To make java available to all users, move the extracted java content to "usr/local/java"/ folder.

$ su
password: (type password of root user)
$ mkdir /opt/jdk
$ mv jdk-1.8.0_60 /opt/jdk/


Step:-4
Set path

To set path and JAVA_HOME variables, add the following commands to ~/.bashrc file.

export JAVA_HOME =/usr/jdk/jdk-1.8.0_60
export PATH=$PATH:$JAVA_HOME/bin

Now apply all the changes into current running system.

$ source ~/.bashrc


Step 5 - Apache Kafka Installation

Let us continue with the following steps to install Kafka on your machine.
Step 5.1 - Download Kafka

To install Kafka on your machine, click on the below link −
https://www.apache.org/dyn/closer.cgi?path=/kafka/0.9.0.0/kafka_2.11-0.9.0.0.tgz

Now the latest version i.e., – kafka_2.11_0.9.0.0.tgz will be downloaded onto your machine.

But i am using below version.

wget http://apache.mirrors.lucidnetworks.net/kafka/0.8.2.1/kafka_2.10-0.8.2.1.tgz

Step 5.2 - Extract the tar file

Extract the tar file using the following command −

$ cd opt/
$ tar -zxf kafka_2.10-0.8.2.1.tgz
$ cd kafka_2.10-0.8.2.1

Now you have downloaded the latest version of Kafka on your machine.

Step 5.3 - Start Server

You can start the server by giving the following command −

$ bin/kafka-server-start.sh config/server.properties

After the server starts, you would see the below response on your screen −

$ bin/kafka-server-start.sh config/server.properties
[2016-01-02 15:37:30,410] INFO KafkaConfig values:
request.timeout.ms = 30000
log.roll.hours = 168
inter.broker.protocol.version = 0.9.0.X
log.preallocate = false
security.inter.broker.protocol = PLAINTEXT
…………………………………………….
…………………………………………….

Step 6 - Stop the Server
